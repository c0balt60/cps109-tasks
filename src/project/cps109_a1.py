Task
Come up with a problem you wish to solve and describe it in a paragraph or two. Your
description should be technical and precise - no vague handwaving. The clearer the
problem description, the easier it will be to solve in Python

Your program must demonstrate each of the following Python elements at least once:
â€¢ Variable declarations and assignments
â€¢ Arithmetic expressions (can include function calls)
â€¢ Use of if/elif/else statement
â€¢ Use of sequence types and their operations (strings, lists, tuples)
â€¢ Use of a for loop for sequence iteration (a list comprehension works here also)
â€¢ Use of a while loop for general iteration (driven by a condition)
â€¢ A user-defined function for solving some meaningful subproblem.
â€¢ Print statements for displaying output (user input is allowed, but not required)
â€¢ Read input from a file OR write output to a file.


Out of 30 marks:
3 marks Clear and concrete problem description
2 marks 20 lines of (meaningful) comments
6 marks 60 lines of (meaningful) code
1 mark Use of variables and arithmetic expressions
2 marks Use of if/elif/else statements (with conditions)
2 marks Use of sequence iteration (for loop, comprehension, etc.)
2 marks Use of general iteration (while loop)
3 marks Use of at least one user-defined function
2 marks Use of print statements to display program output
4 marks Use of files for input and/or output
3 marks Program adequately solves the described problem

Submition:
- python file with name: cps109_a1.py
- screenshot of your IDE showing the code alongside the output in the terminal
- any input text file(s) required by your program
- any output text file(s) produced when your program is executed

-> screenshot should be named :: cps109_a1_output.xxxx where xxxx is (png, jpg, ...)

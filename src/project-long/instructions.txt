Task
Come up with a problem you wish to solve and describe it in a paragraph or two. Your
description should be technical and precise - no vague handwaving. The clearer the
problem description, the easier it will be to solve in Python

Your program must demonstrate each of the following Python elements at least once:
• Variable declarations and assignments
• Arithmetic expressions (can include function calls)
• Use of if/elif/else statement
• Use of sequence types and their operations (strings, lists, tuples)
• Use of a for loop for sequence iteration (a list comprehension works here also)
• Use of a while loop for general iteration (driven by a condition)
• A user-defined function for solving some meaningful subproblem.
• Print statements for displaying output (user input is allowed, but not required)
• Read input from a file OR write output to a file.


Out of 30 marks:
3 marks Clear and concrete problem description
2 marks 20 lines of (meaningful) comments
6 marks 60 lines of (meaningful) code
1 mark Use of variables and arithmetic expressions
2 marks Use of if/elif/else statements (with conditions)
2 marks Use of sequence iteration (for loop, comprehension, etc.)
2 marks Use of general iteration (while loop)
3 marks Use of at least one user-defined function
2 marks Use of print statements to display program output
4 marks Use of files for input and/or output
3 marks Program adequately solves the described problem

Submition:
- python file with name: cps109_a1.py
- screenshot of your IDE showing the code alongside the output in the terminal
- any input text file(s) required by your program
- any output text file(s) produced when your program is executed

-> screenshot should be named :: cps109_a1_output.xxxx where xxxx is (png, jpg, ...)


Problem Description:
Finance type app:


💰 Finance & Productivity Tools

Budget Tracker – Input expenses, categorize them, and show monthly summaries.

Bill Reminder CLI – Let users input recurring bills and show which ones are due soon.

Currency Converter – Fetch exchange rates using an API and convert between currencies.

Invoice Generator – Generate simple PDF invoices using reportlab or fpdf.

Time Tracker – Record how much time you spend on tasks or projects.

Tip Calculator / Split Bill Tool – A simple calculator for groups at restaurants.

Interest Calculator – Compute compound and simple interest for savings or loans.


Programming Problem:

Many tools nowadays use overcomplicated and confusing interfaces for expense tracking and budgeting
For this reason, I will be creating a CLI tool that saves you the hassle!
This tool will be able to do the following:
    - track expenses and calculate budget
    - track income


User data is stored as following:

username: ...
password: ...
---SectionName
* values *
---SectionName


Features to include:
- Net finances
    > net total
- Daily expense Tracker
    > add expense "string" float (tracks expense today)
    > add income "string" float (tracks income today)
        > flag -c "string" (name of category to assign to)
        > flag -l type (list all stored budgeting items under the type: income/expense)

- Categories
    > category new "string" (creates new category)
        > flag -l (lists all categories)

- Savings goals
    > goal new "string" float (adds a savings goal and )
    > goal "string" (shows percentage towards goal)
        > flag -l (lists all goals)

Code related:
> "Budget" item will have either "expense" or "income", and have tags for: goals["",...], categories["",...]
